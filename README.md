## Requirements

Hitimes requires the following to run:

  * Ruby

## Usage

Hitimes easiest to use when installed with `rubygems`:

```sh
gem install hitimes
```

Or as part of your bundler `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'hitimes'
```

You can load it with the standard ruby require statement.

```ruby
require 'hitimes'
```

### Interval

Use `Hitimes::Interval` to calculate only the duration of a block of code.
Returns the time as seconds.

```ruby
duration = Hitimes::Interval.measure do
             1_000_000.times do |x|
               2 + 2
             end
           end

puts duration  # => 0.047414297 (seconds)
```

### TimedMetric

Use a `Hitimes::TimedMetric` to calculate statistics about an iterative operation

```ruby
timed_metric = Hitimes::TimedMetric.new('operation on items')
```

Explicitly use `start` and `stop`:

```ruby
collection.each do |item|
  timed_metric.start
  # .. do something with item
  timed_metric.stop
end
```

Or use the block. In `TimedMetric` the return value of `measure` is the return
value of the block.

```ruby
collection.each do |item|
  result_of_do_something = timed_metric.measure { do_something( item ) }
end
```
And then look at the stats

```ruby
puts timed_metric.mean
puts timed_metric.max
puts timed_metric.min
puts timed_metric.stddev
puts timed_metric.rate
```
### ValueMetric

Use a `Hitimes::ValueMetric` to calculate statistics about measured samples.

``` ruby
value_metric = Hitimes::ValueMetric.new( 'size of thing' )
loop do
  # ... do stuff changing sizes of 'thing'
  value_metric.measure( thing.size )
  # ... do other stuff that may change size of thing
end

puts value_metric.mean
puts value_metric.max
puts value_metric.min
puts value_metric.stddev
puts value_metric.rate
```

### TimedValueMetric

Use a `Hitimes::TimedValueMetric` to calculate statistics about batches of samples.

``` ruby
timed_value_metric = Hitimes::TimedValueMetric.new( 'batch times' )
loop do 
  batch = ... # get a batch of things
  timed_value_metric.start
  # .. do something with batch
  timed_value_metric.stop( batch.size )
end

puts timed_value_metric.rate

puts timed_value_metric.timed_stats.mean
puts timed_value_metric.timed_stats.max
puts timed_value_metric.timed_stats.min
puts timed_value_metric.timed_stats.stddev

puts timed_value_metric.value_stats.mean
puts timed_value_metric.value_stats.max
puts timed_value_metric.value_stats.min
puts timed_value_metric.value_stats.stddev
```

### Implementation details

Hitimes use the appropriate low-level system call for each operating system to
get the highest granularity time increment possible. Generally this is
nanosecond resolution, or whatever the hardware chip in the CPU supports.

It currently supports any of the following systems:

* any system with the POSIX call `clock_gettime()`
* Mac OS X
* Windows
* JRuby

## Support

Hitimes is supported on whatever versions of ruby are currently supported.
Hitimes also follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

The current officially supported versions of Ruby are:

* MRI Ruby (all platforms) 2.3 - 2.6
* JRuby 9.1.17.0, 9.2.X.X

Unofficially supported versions, these have been supported in the past when they
were the primary rubies around. In all likelihood they still work, but are not
supported.

* MRI Ruby (linux/mac/bsd/unix/etc) - everything from 1.8.7 to 2.2
* MRI Ruby (windows) - 2.0 and up
  * Ruby 1.8 and 1.9 for windows are supported in hitimes version 1.2.4 or earlier
* JRuby - I think everything back to 1.4
* Rubinius
