== DESCRIPTION

Hitimes is a fast, high resolution timer library for recording
performance metrics.  It uses the appropriate C method calls for each
system to get the highest granularity time increments possible.  

It currently supports any system with the POSIX call clock_gettime(),
Mac OS X and Windows.

Using Hitimes can be faster than using a series of Time.new calls, and
it will have a much higher granularity.   It is definitely faster than
using Process.times. 

== SYNOPSIS

Use Hitimes::Interval to calculate only the duration of a block of code

  duration = Hitimes::Interval.measure do
               # some operation ...
             end

  puts duration   

Use a Hitimes::Timer to calculate statistics about an iterative operation

  timer = Hitimes::Timer.new
  collection.each do |item|
    timer.start
    # .. do something with item
    timer.stop
  end

  puts timer.mean
  puts timer.median
  puts timer.max
  puts timer.min
  puts timer.stddev
  puts timer.rate
